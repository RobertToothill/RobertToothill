:file_folder: Professional Experience

I have nearly 10 years of experience working on data-driven projects for motor dealerships across the UK. My expertise lies in cleaning, modeling, and preparing data sourced from Keyloop (Kerridge system) using SQL, and presenting this data through tools like SSRS, MicroStrategy, Power BI, and custom HTML code.

These projects focus on creating comprehensive Management Information (MI) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) dashboards for sales teams, administrative staff, and senior management.

MI Tools for Dealerships: Developed Stock Lists that provide real-time insights into stock levels, margins, ages, and agency levels, giving dealerships a clear overview of their inventory. This includes live data integration from SQL Server Reporting Services, utilizing SQL functions and stored procedures to fetch and display actionable insights.

Sales and Purchase Ledger Summaries: Created summaries with interactive drill-down features, allowing users to view account-level details for better financial tracking.

Order Tracking Tools: Developed custom tools to track orders by pulling daily franchise data through web scraping techniques and Microsoft Remote Desktop Automation. This data is replicated in SQL and transformed into interactive MI dashboards using stored procedures. Additionally, I have implemented HTML-based MI reports that are generated within SQL and integrated seamlessly into Microsoft Forms using Microsoft Flow. These reports are fully functional with drill-downs programmed entirely in SQL.
